### Two-factor authentication

 Implemented the frontend of a simple two-factor authentication solution using React with TypeScript.

The front-end application has:
- Ability accept the phone number that the user wants to validate
- Ability to allow the user to enter the one-time password for verification, and
- Ability to finally show if the number has been correctly validated or not (that is, if the password is correct or not)
